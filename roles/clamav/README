This directory should hold playbook, files, and hosts for ClamAV installation for Linux systems.

*Before running playbook installclam_lnx.yml, edit the top line - hosts: <group> to the corresponding group in /hosts/clamhosts that requires ClamAV. 
*To avoid Ansible ssh error, please run the script allow_ssh.sh after reading the README in /home/USERNAME/allow_ssh/

The default playbook installs ONLY clamav, without clamav-daemon in order to reduce memory usage on hosts. To install the daemon (which will require ~500Mb memory on hosts), uncomment all of the LEFTMOST # in installclam_lnx.yml. Indented # are there for possible added functionalities but are NOT NECESSARY. Uncommenting will result in errors.

Exim4 installation is bundled with this playbook to allow for email notification upon the detection of a virus after a scan has completed. 

====Commands to run the playbook are listed below with brief description====

Check which hosts playbook will run on (does not install anything):
ansible-playbook -i /home/USERNAME/clamav/hosts/clamhosts /home/USERNAME/clamav/playbooks/installclam_lnx.yml --list-hosts

Test run (recommended as first time run to check for any host issues, does not install anything, but as such, may encounter errors that a real run will resolve):
ansible-playbook -i /home/USERNAME/clamav/hosts/clamhosts /home/USERNAME/clamav/playbooks/installclam_lnx.yml --ask-sudo-pass --check

Run the playbook from any directory, prompting for sudo password once in the beginning:
ansible-playbook -i /home/USERNAME/clamav/hosts/clamhosts /home/USERNAME/clamav/playbooks/installclam_lnx.yml --ask-sudo-pass

Extra information about this clamav installation:
clamav installation comes with the clamav virus database updater freshclam, which automatically updates the database using the configuration file freshclam.conf found in /files/ and default installs to /etc/clamav/ on hosts. This file can be modified as desired, documentation here: https://linux.die.net/man/5/freshclam.conf

clamav-daemon is a background process that consumes some system memory but allows for faster scans via clamdscan instead of clamscan. Clamdscan uses configuration file clamd.conf found in /files/ and default installs to /etc/clamav/ on hosts. It can also be modified as desired, documentation here: https://linux.die.net/man/5/clamd.conf

exim4 is the mail transfer agent used to send a notification email upon virus detection. The config file for exim4, update-exim4.conf.conf is found in /files/ and default installs to /etc/exim4/ on hosts and should not be edited unless necessary. Before editing update-exim4.conf.conf, verify that the new config works as expected on a test host, otherwise email relay may not work!
